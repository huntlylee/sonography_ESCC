# Risk Prediction for Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis in Esophageal Cancer

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This repository presents a machine learning (ML) framework developed to predict cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) using preoperative ultrasound and clinical data. The model aims to support personalized surgical planning and reduce unnecessary lymph node dissections.

## ðŸ“š Background
Cervical lymph node dissection in ESCC remains controversial due to its associated risks and uncertain survival benefits. Traditional imaging modalities like PET/CT are costly and often ineffective for small nodes. Ultrasound offers a non-invasive, accessible alternative, and when combined with ML, can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-Python 3.8 or above
-Jupyter Notebook
-Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, xgboost, lightgbm, joblib

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
pip install xgboost
pip install lightgbm
pip install joblib
```

## Usage

The source code in this repository enables full reproduction of our study findings, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Trained models can be directly applied to new patient data for predictive inference.

We are actively developing an automated pipeline to streamline the entire workflowâ€”from data input to prediction output. Contributions are warmly welcomed to enhance its functionality, robustness, and clinical integration.

Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues to share your ideas and help advance this tool for precision oncology.
